  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I am a 32 year old bartender at a wine bar. I have 8 years of laboratory work, as well as years of working as a handyman. I want coding to be a part of my life because of it's ubiquitous nature. As listed in my favorite things, I enjoy climbing rocks and mountains as well as surfing off of the Oregon Coast. My cat, Hobbes, is a wonderful yet standoffish partner.</p>
