  <h4>Hello, and welcome to my independent project.</h4>
  
  
  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <div class="box"><p>After graduating from Pennsylvania State University with a STEM degree, I worked as a handyman. After my handyman position, I worked for 8 years of in various laboratory positions before becoming a lab manager. After comtemplating the dangerous nature of lab jobs, I decided to move to the wine industry. I spent my first harvest season in 2019 at a winery in Dundee, Oregon. I now work as a bartender in a wonderful wine bar. I want coding to be a part of my life because of it's ubiquitous nature. As listed in my favorite things, I enjoy <span class="highlight">climbing rocks</span> and mountains as well as <span class="highlight">surfing</span> off of the Oregon Coast. My cat, Hobbes, is a wonderful yet standoffish partner.</p>
